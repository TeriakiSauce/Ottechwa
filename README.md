# Ottechwa
A website created to aggregate relevant tech companies based in the Ottawa region and cities near it.

A python script first reads a csv file with all the companies and their websites. The script sorts the dataset alphabetically and generates a json file based on it.

The javascript file then parses the json and generates buttons corresponding to the data.
